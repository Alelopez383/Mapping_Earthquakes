# Mapping_Earthquakes
Creating interactive maps using GeoJSON data to explore earthquakes around the world.

# Purpose
We want to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. To do that, we are going to use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

We are using JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data; Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

# To create a map:
- The index.html file
- Th style.css file
- The config.js file, which will hold our Mapbox API key.
- The logic.js file, which will contain all the JavaScript and Leaflet code to create the map and add data to the map.


# Tools
1. JavaScript ES6
2. D3 library (Data-Driven Documents)
3. Geo Json
4. Leaflet library
5. Mapobox API
